    <h2>13. Hello again</h2>
    <p>
        Hello old friend.<br>
        I thought we decided to forget each other?<br>
        <br>
        No,<br>
        you cannot plant your seeds here.<br>
        My garden is meant for others.<br>
        <br>
        Just stay out there in the waters.<br>
        The shallows are where I can care for them.<br>
        <br>
        Oh, but your depths call with the addictive ring of past truths.<br>
        Maybe just for a moment,<br>
        I can indulge.<br>
        <br>
        I will be sure to trim your branches before long,<br>
        lest I become drunk with the sweetness of your fruit.<br>
        <br>
        I am old my friend,<br>
        and you are dead.<br>
        We will meet again,<br>
        and again,<br>
        right up until the end.<br>
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h2>12. Sorry and Please</h2>
    <p>
        If I was a rich man, I would give you the earth.<br>
        If I was warm, you would giggle with mirth.<br>
        If I was a healer, you would never ache.<br>
        After your nightmare, I'll be there when you wake.<br>
        <br>
        I will heal you with time.<br>
        Warm you with absence.<br>
        <br>
        If you were poison, I would drink my fill.<br>
        If you were fire, I want to burn.<br>
        I am nothing without you, and that is okay.<br>
        <br>
        Please don't leave.<br>
        We are only getting started.<br>
        <br>
        You are my tomorrow.<br>
        Your absence is larger than reason.<br>
        My mind is stuck on the thought of you, like a moth to a flame.<br>
        Nothing is real.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>11. Howl</h2>
    <p>
        "Why do you eat us?" asked the deer.<br>
        "Because we are hungry." said the wolf.<br>
        "Then why not eat the leaves?" she replied.<br>
        "If we eat leaves, we die."<br>
        "What about berries?"<br>
        "We can't eat berries either."<br>
        "And the insects? There are far more of them than us."<br>
        "We cannot catch enough of them. Hunting deer is all we have ever known." the wolf said dejectedly.<br>
        "I see."<br>
        "Asking why a wolf eats a deer is no less silly than asking why the wind cries at night."<br>
        The wolf was silent.<br>
        "Except you do not cry." added the deer.<br>
        "No, but we howl just like the wind. We howl for what we have done, and we howl for what we are going to do."<br>
        "I think I would rather eat leaves." she replied, looking down.<br>
        Waiting.<br>

    <h2>10. Asymptote</h2>
    <p>
        You are a bird<br>
        and I, a fish.<br>
        All I have is<br>
        my word.<br>
        A hollow offering<br>
        to satiate your wish.<br>
        <br>
        You love the dancing lights on the edge of my realm,<br>
        but you fear the depths.<br>
        From above, the obfuscated brightness sustains me,<br>
        but higher, I could never reach.<br>
        <br>
        I cannot fly.<br>
        You cannot swim.<br>
        I, forever following<br>
        a shadow<br>
        and you following<br>
        a fin.<br>
        <br>
        We long to be seen, we yearn to be felt.<br>
        Eternally skirting the water's edge.<br>
        Drowning, burning, freezing, asphyxiating<br>
        I want to believe, I want to breathe.<br>
        But the sight of your suffering<br>
        makes me weak.<br>
        <br>
        The depths are calling.<br>
        They are calling for me.<br>
        I will embrace the blackness,<br>
        if it means you are free.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>9. Nights like these</h2>
    <p>
        At nights like these<br>
        I know it's true.<br>
        At nights like these<br>
        when I yearn for you.<br>
        <br>
        The silence, your voice.<br>
        The cold, your warmth.<br>
        The absence, your existence.<br>
        <br>
        At nights like these<br>
        when only, indirectly you are<br>
        At nights like these<br>
        with you so far.<br>
        <br>
        I find solace<br>
        in the lack of you.<br>
        I find comfort<br>
        in the pain.<br>
        <br>
        Shoes, dishes, smell<br>
        Tiny inconsistencies attesting to you<br>
        Longing, craving, desire<br>
        Proof of the one these belong to.<br>
        <br>
        At nights like these<br>
        with your ghost for company<br>
        At nights like these<br>
        I find a lullaby in your memory.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>8. Waiting in waste</h2>
    <p>
        I know you don't feel as you used to.<br>
        I know your mind does not allow you to.<br>

        The person you were is entirely encompassed by<br>
        vestiges of regret and abandonment.<br>
        The person you are is sad, solitary, sorrowful,<br>
        and strong.<br>
        <br>
        You hurt me.<br>
        Like the indifferent sun hurts a dehydrated desert walker.<br>
        But, I am strong.<br>
        Loneliness is my homeland and yearning my air.<br>
        <br>
        I will be here.<br>
        Just beyond the boundary of your winter.<br>
        Vigilant and firm.<br>
        <br>
        But hurry my muse.<br>
        Time eats us all.<br>
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h2>7. Husk</h2>
    <p>
        Where is the light?<br>
        I know this is where I left it,<br>
        hotly radiating from your eyes.<br>
        What I see now is two cold crevices.<br>
        Please bring it back.<br>
        <br>
        Your kind mellifluous giggle<br>
        replaced by sound.<br>
        Your soft cautious touch<br>
        replaced by air.<br>
        Your warm unguarded emotion<br>
        replaced by words.<br>
        <br>
        We meet more than ever<br>
        but you cannot be farther<br>
        Please come back.<br>
        Please<br>
        Please<br>
        Please<br>
        Please<br>
        please<br>
        please<br>
        please<br>
        please<br>
        please<br>
        please<br>
        please<br>
        please<br>
        please<br>

    <h2>6. What we are</h2>
    <p>
        We are all automatons<br>
        traversing this world<br>
        soulless and cold<br>
        <br>
        We peer at each other<br>
        through tiny windows<br>
        hoping for signals of life<br>
        <br>
        We pass notes<br>
        through dedicated holes<br>
        masters of steganography<br>
        <br>
        We sometimes notice anomalies<br>
        cracks in the paint<br>
        faulty lights<br>
        <br>
        We rationalize and ignore<br>
        Why bother?<br>
        My unit is just as broken.<br>
        <br>
        We are created<br>
        flawed and isolated<br>
        with no chance of recall<br>
        <br>
        We wander around<br>
        decrepit and condemned<br>
        waiting to expire.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>5. Jilt</h2>
    <p>
        Goodbye bed hair<br>
        Goodbye laugh lines<br>
        Goodbye crooked tooth<br>
        Goodbye eyes<br>
        <br>
        I wish I was stronger<br>
        I wish I was tough<br>
        I wish I was more<br>
        I wish I was enough<br>
        <br>
        Goodbye darling<br>
        Goodbye me too<br>
        Goodbye sweetie<br>
        Goodbye you<br>
        <br>
        Believe me, I tried<br>
        I really did<br>
        I believed too<br>
        So much it hurt<br>
        <br>
        Goodbye closeness<br>
        Goodbye possibility<br>
        Goodbye solace<br>
        Goodbye honesty<br>
        Goodbye hope<br>
    </p>

    <h2>4. Balance</h2>
    <p>
        It is always there<br>
        nebulous and thick<br>
        lingering above my shoulders<br>
        oppressive and chronic<br>
        <br>
        It abhors happiness<br>
        and pleasure too<br>
        countering every warm feeling<br>
        with a whisper, wintry and true<br>
        <br>
        In the late hours<br>
        of a solitary night<br>
        it becomes corporeal<br>
        rearing for its delight<br>
        <br>
        Cutting the flesh<br>
        with claws of purgatory<br>
        Searing the skin<br>
        with a breath, mercifully<br>
        <br>
        I am mangled and mutilated<br>
        bloody and blue<br>
        But I will face it every night<br>
        if it means a morning with you<br>
    </p>

    <h2>3. The hermit</h2>
    <p>
        On the side of a hill there is a house,<br>
        within which lives a hermit.<br>
        Never needing pet nor spouse,<br>
        innocuously abutting a road.<br>
        <br>
        Polite waves greet every passing stranger.<br>
        Equivalent gestures are common.<br>
        Few notice the windowed upper chamber<br>
        and even fewer notice the eyes.<br>
        <br>
        At night cries are heard from the nearby settlement<br>
        and rumors are spreading.<br>
        about fallacies regarding the hermit's banishment<br>
        and his isolation.<br>
        <br>
        An intrepid coterie decides to investigate the house<br>
        in order to uncover the truth.<br>
        On the front door a letter reads "leave"<br>
        Inside one reads "thank you".<br>
    </p>

    <h2>2. Miss</h2>
    <p>
        At first there was me.<br>
        A single speck of pseudo something in a vast
        solipsistic sea of nothing.<br>
        I look around.<br>
        Pitch. Pitch in all directions.<br>
        The silence only broken by echoes reflected off of<br>
        objects [no, beings] transient and intangible.<br>
        This is me, sedated, submissive, scarcely sentient.<br>
        Shiftless.<br>
        <br>
        Then there was another.<br>
        Kicking and screaming.<br>
        Rapidly, we drift toward each other.<br>
        Confused and frantic; I stretch out toward<br>
        this terrifying wonder.<br>
        I miss.<br>
        Fruitlessly I cry in its direction<br>
        Pleading.<br>
        It slows down momentarily. Then resumes its<br>
        course into the darkness<br>
        This is me. Isolated, evanescing, evaporating.<br>
        An echo.<br>
    </p>
